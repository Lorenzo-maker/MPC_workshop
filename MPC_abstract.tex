	Model Predictive Control (MPC) is often used in online control of various systems and processes in the chemical, mechanical and electrical fields.
	Here its use is focused in autonomous driving.
	In particular, it is investigated whether a minimalistic MPC based on a point-mass model is able to drive, as fast as possible, a far more complex multibody vehicle model.
	A methodology, known as \emph{MPC offset-free}, is then tested and proves to be able to represent differences between the MPC internal model and the driven vehicle as disturbances that acts on the minimalistic vehicle model.

\section{Introduction}
Autonomous driving is one of the most discussed and actual topics both in academia and industry.
% Here, we focus our attention on autonomous race cars.
In the related literature, mainly three different approaches are employed in order to compute online control inputs for autonomous cars.
In the first one, the control of the vehicle is achieved by a deep dense neural network, which is trained with recorded vehicle data to represent the vehicle's dynamic behaviour~\cite{Hermansdorfer2020, Zhu2018, Navarro2018}. In the second approach, a model predictive control (MPC) solves, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open-loop control problem, using the current state of the system as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied as an input~\cite{Liniger2015, Novi2019, Verschueren2014}. The last method is a mix of the previous approaches. Here, a learning model predictive control (LNMPC) is used in order to find optimal control actions and
to learn the system model and the disturbance acting on it through the data from previous trajectories~\cite{Rosolia2016, Brunner2017, Limon2017}.

In this work, starting from the classical MPC approach, a minimalistic MPC is employed, where a very simplified vehicle model is used as the internal model in order to reduce the computational burden.
Offset-free theory~\cite{Pannocchia2015} is put on a test, where the internal model dynamics is properly augmented with a disturbance estimation in order to compensate for the differences between the MPC model and the driven vehicle.

\subsection{Model of the simulated vehicle}
The simulated vehicle, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Adams_vehicle}, is a multibody model of a Formula SAE car, developed in MSC.Adams by means of the graphical user interface: parts were built starting form rigid-body primitives, whereas the elasticities were gathered in the spring-dampers and the anti-roll bars.

The mass and inertia of the frame, the engine, the driver, the fuel tank and the final transmission were evaluated by means of 3D CAD models and assigned to the sprung mass in the multibody model.

The suspension architecture is a classical upper and lower \emph{A-arm} with push rod both at front and rear wheels. The \texttt{PAC2002} Magic-Formula is used as tire model, whose parameters were supplied by the Formula SAE Tire Test Consortium, based on experimental tests performed on Hoosier 20.5x7.0-13 tire.

The model receives two control inputs from the MPC controller: the steering angle $\delta_v$ and the total longitudinal force $F_{x}$. This is equally distributed to the rear wheels (i.e. open differential) by imposing the same drive torque at left and right rear wheels.

\end{figure}



\subsection{MPC internal model}

In order to race the full-fledged MSC.Adams vehicle we build an MPC dynamic model from first principles which strives to be as minimalistic as possible for maximum computational efficiency yet able to capture the fundamentals of vehicle dynamics. To this sake, a point-mass model is devised, embodying the dynamics of the center of mass (CoM) of the full model.
This model has 3 DoFs with respect to the track spine and, worthily enough, it employs the very same basic parameters of the full vehicle, i.e. mass, aerodynamic coefficients, grip and power limits for braking and traction phases. These are usually readily available even for a complex vehicle.

Control inputs are the longitudinal force $F_{x}$, and the angular acceleration around the vertical axis $r_p = dr/dt$, where $r$ is the yaw rate~\footnote{It is worth remarking that the apparent nonsense of introducing the yaw rate for a point mass is resolved if one thinks of its dynamics written in the body-fixed reference frame. This justifies the introduction of a yaw rate for the point mass which is the same as the body-fixed reference frame's yaw rate.}.

The steering angle $\delta_v$, needed to control the simulated vehicle, can be extracted by assuming that
\begin{equation}
\delta_v = \alpha_{1} + \beta_1 = F_{y_{11}}/C_\alpha + (v + ra_1)/u
\end{equation}
where, exploiting the same notation in~\cite{Guiggiani2018}, $C_\alpha$ is the cornering stiffness of the front tire and $a_1$ is the distance between the Centre of Mass (CoM) and the front axle.
Tire slip angles $\alpha_{1i}$ and vehicle slip angles $\beta_{1i}$ are assumed equal for each wheel $i=1, 2$ of the same axle, hence $\alpha_{11} = \alpha_{12} = \alpha_{1}$ and $\beta_{11} = \beta_{12} = \beta_{1}$.
%
Front wheel lateral forces $F_{y_{1i}}$ are estimated within the steady-state assumption, leading to $F_{y_{11}} = F_{y_{12}} = F_{y}a_2/(2l)$.
$F_{y}$, included as an algebraic state, incorporates the total lateral force acting on the vehicle model. Then, $a_2$ is the distance between the CoM and the rear axle and $l$ is the wheelbase.

\subsection{Spatial formulation}

The race track, assumed planar, is modelled through the parametric 2D curve
\begin{equation}
\mathcal C(s) = \{ \vec x (s) = [x(s), y(s)]^T \in \mathbb{R}^2 : s \in [s_0, s_f] \}
\end{equation}
%
that identifies the road centerline (aka track spine), and the 1D curve $\mathcal W(s)$ that specifies the track width.
% With reference to Figure~\ref{fig:scheme_frenet_serret_refsys},
The \emph{curve parameter} $s$ uniquely selects a point $\vec F = \vec x(s)$ that defines the origin of the \emph{Frenet-Serret frame} $\mathcal F = \{ \vec F, (\vec t, \vec p) \}$ with unit tangent and normal vectors $\vec t$ and $\vec p$ of $\mathcal C$ at point $\vec F$.
%
The vehicle reference system $\mathcal V = \{ \vec G, (\vec i, \vec j) \}$ can be expressed with the aid of the moving frame $\mathcal F$ with a \emph{lateral displacement} $e_p$ along the track normal direction $\vec p$ and the \emph{heading error} $e_\psi$.
% = \psi_f - \psi_v
In order to maintain $\mathcal F$ side-by-side with $\mathcal V$, the Frenet-Serret system has to move together with the vehicle: this leads to a relation between vehicle and Frenet-Serret velocities that ultimately imposes a bond between time and $s$ increments.

%The final formulation of the vehicle model dynamics, % TODO: ref to standard formulation, if previously exposed
%extended with lateral displacement, heading error and transposed in spatial domain is
%
%\begin{equation} \left\{
%\begin{aligned}
%u_{,\alpha} &= \frac{\norm{\hat{\vec x}_{,\alpha}}}{s_p} \left[ \frac{1}{m} (F_{x} - X_a) + vr \right] \\

%e_{p,\alpha} &= \frac{\norm{\hat{\vec x}_{,\alpha}}}{s_p} \left[ u \sin{e_\psi} + v \cos{e_\psi} \right] \\
%e_{\psi,\alpha} &= \norm{\hat{\vec x}_{,\alpha}} \left( \frac{r}{s_p} - k \right),
%\end{aligned} \right.

\subsection{OCP problem formulation}

The centroidal dynamics is formulated in spatial domain instead of time, and the \emph{direct collocation method} is used to transform the \emph{Optimal Control Problem} (OCP) into a \emph{Non-Linear Program} (NLP). The NLP is coded in a scripting environment using the Matlab interface to the open-source CasADi framework~\cite{Andersson2019}, which provides building
blocks to efficiently formulate and solve large-scale optimization problems, and solved through IPOPT~\cite{Wachter2006}.

The OCP is formulated with the goal of finding the optimal control sequence necessary to minimize the travel time of the next $l_N$ meters of the track ahead of the vehicle.

\subsection{Offset-free MPC}
\label{sec:offsetfree}

An important passage of the proposed work is the attempt to reduce the problem complexity by lightening the vehicle model.
Unmodeled dynamics are considered as external disturbances (linear in the state vector $\vec x$) that act on the system: these disturbances can be estimated and properly re-introduced into the vehicle dynamics.

As presented in~\cite{Pannocchia2015}, a simple method to compensate unmeasured disturbances is to:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item model the disturbance,
	\item use the measurements and the model to estimate the disturbance,
	\item find the inputs that minimise its effect on the controlled variables.
\end{enumerate*}

The nominal model $\vec x^+=f(\vec x, \vec u)$, assumed observable, is augmented with an estimate of the disturbances acting on the controlled vehicle, called \emph{disturbance state} vector $\vec d$.
% , written as $\vec x^+=f(\vec x, \vec d, \vec u)$.

Disturbance state dynamics is chosen by considering the zero-offset goal: to achieve offset-free performance against asymptotically constant disturbances, the disturbance state $\vec d$ has an \emph{integrating} evolution, i.e. $\vec d^+ = \vec d$ in discrete time domain.
The augmented model can be employed to produce, at any sample time, a prediction of the next vehicle state and, once a new vehicle state measurement is obtained, the disturbance state estimate can be updated.

% \cite{Pannocchia2015} demonstrated that
If the actual disturbance is both asymptotically constant or slowly varying, a NLP based on the augmented model, exploiting the proposed disturbance estimate, can cope with external disturbances and plant-model mismatches, acting almost like an MPC with a more complex model but with the benefit of reduced computational burden.

\section{Preliminary results}
The overall system is modeled in MATLAB-Simulink, where five different macro-blocks are developed. In particular, with reference to Fig.~\ref{fig:simulink_blocks}, we note: \textit{Adams \& States Measures}, in which the multibody vehicle model is imported and its states are measured; \textit{Lateral Displacement \& Heading Error Estimation}, where we localize through $e_p$ and $e_\psi$ the vehicle on the track; \textit{Track Visualization} necessary to visualize the $l_n$ meters of the track ahead of the vehicle; \textit{MPC Parameters} and \textit{MPC}. In the first one, necessary control points of the track for its NURBS~\cite{nurbs} representation are calculated, while in the second one the MPC controller computes the optimal control inputs.
\begin{figure}[htb] \centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.\linewidth]{simulink_blocks}
	\caption{Simulink model of the simulated system}
	\label{fig:simulink_blocks}
\end{figure}
The MPC controller is tested on the Indianapolis oval racing track. In particular, three different simulations are performed:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item lap-time simulation with MPC controller in which the aerodynamic drag is modelled,
	\item lap-time simulation with MPC controller in which the aerodynamic drag is deliberately neglected in the MPC internal model,
	\item lap-time simulation in which the aerodynamic drag is deliberately neglected but the MPC internal model is offset-free.
\end{enumerate*}
In the latter, the drag is estimated through the disturbance state technique explained in \ref{sec:offsetfree}.

In each simulation, a receding horizon of length $l_N = 75$m is chosen and the OCP problem is discretized in $N = 40$ intervals. Hence, with a number of states $n_x = 6$, a number of controls $n_u = 2$ and a number of algebrical variables $n_z = 4$, each optimal control problem has 533 variables, 413 equality constraints and 82 inequality constraints. The solution of these problems on a laptop with 2.30GHz
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10875H CPU and 32 GB di RAM requires a computing time $t_c \simeq 60$ms.

Solutions in terms of controlled vehicle trajectories and inputs are compared, focusing on the entry phase of the first curve.

\begin{figure}[htb] \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.\linewidth]{Trajectories2}
	\caption{Trajectories comparison between lap simulation with MPC w/ drag (blue), MPC w/o drag + offset-free (green), MPC w/o drag (red)}
	\label{fig:Trajectories2}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb] \centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.\linewidth]{steer_fx} % FIXME: what is the unit on the abscissa? Minutes (min)?
	\caption{Comparison between control inputs, longitudinal force (top), steering angle of the front wheel (bottom), obtained with MPC w/ drag (blue), MPC w/o drag + offset-free (green) and MPC w/o drag (red)}
	\label{fig:steer_fx}
\end{figure}

Figures.\ref{fig:Trajectories2} - \ref{fig:steer_fx} highlight how MPC w/ drag and MPC w/o drag + offset-free are capable to drive the MSC.Adams vehicle in a practically identical way, with a lap-time difference of $6.5$ms on a total lap-time of $79.8$s. Instead, if the aerodynamic drag is not modelled inside the MPC, as in MPC w/o drag, the controller is not able to maintain the real vehicle on the track: in fact the simulation fails on the entry phase of the second curve.

\section{Conclusion}
The minimalistic MPC based solely on the vehicle centroidal dynamics seems enough to race the complex vehicle counterpart.
% NOTE: 'In particular' or 'However'? The following sentence seems a limitation
In particular, parameters of the MPC model such as mass, aerodynamic coefficients or power limits, have to be equal to those of the driven car: in this way the point-mass model can be considered as a condensed model of the complex vehicle itself.

Nevertheless, the offset-free technique is a powerful and efficient addendum that allows to relax even further the internal model. It is also forgiving enough to allow the adjustment of some uncertain yet fundamental parameters of the complex vehicle in a convenient way at run time.
As a proof of concept, an internal model agnostic of the aerodynamic drag and where the drag force is estimated through the disturbance state $d$ (MPC w/o drag + offset-free) records performances similar to the complete model (MPC w/ drag).

Further developments to the MPC internal model, as well as new approaches to the estimation of the steer angle, are envisioned with the goal of driving the full vehicle in conditions even closer to handling limits.
