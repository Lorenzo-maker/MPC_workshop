abstract = {The optimal control and lap time optimization of vehicles such as racing cars and motorcycle is a challenging problem, in particular the approach adopted in the problem formulation has a great impact on the actual possibility of solving such problem by using numerical techniques. This paper illustrates a methodology which combines some modelling technique which have been found to be numerically efficient. The methodology is based on the 3D curvilinear coordinates technique for the road modelling, the moving frame approach for the derivation of the vehicle equations of motion, the replacement of the time with the position along the track as new independent variable and the formulation and the solution of the minimum lap time problem by means of the indirect approach. The case study of a GT car is presented and simulation examples are given and discussed.},

abstract = {An algorithm for the numerical solution of parameterized optimal control problems is presented, which is based on multiple shooting in connection with a recursive quadratic programming technique. A condensing algorithm for the solution of the approximating linearly constrained quadratic subproblems, and high rank update procedures are introduced, which are especially suited for optimal control problems and lead to significant improvements of the convergence behaviour and reductions of computing time and storage requirements. The algorithm is completely derivative-free due to internal numerical differentiation schemes, it can be conveniently combined with indirect multiple shooting. Numerical results are given in the field of aerospace engineering.},

@book{Nocedal2006,
abstract = {Summary: Numerical Optimization presents a comprehensive and up-to-date description of the most effective methods in continuous optimization. It responds to the growing interest in optimization in engineering, science, and business by focusing on the methods that are best suited to practical problems. For this new edition the book has been thoroughly updated throughout. There are new chapters on nonlinear interior methods and derivative-free methods for optimization, both of which are used widely in practice and the focus of much current research. Because of the emphasis on practical methods, as well as the extensive illustrations and exercises, the book is accessible to a wide audience. It can be used as a graduate text in engineering, operations research, mathematics, computer science, and business. It also serves as a handbook for researchers and practitioners in the field. The authors have strived to produce a text that is pleasant to read, informative, and rigorous - one that reveals both the beautiful nature of the discipline and its practical side.},

abstract = {We Optimize Really Huge Problems (WORHP) is a solver for large-scale, sparse, nonlinear optimization problems with millions of variables and constraints. Convexity is not required, but some smoothness and regularity assumptions are necessary for the underlying theory and the algorithms based on it. WORHP has been designed from its core foundations as a sparse sequential quadratic programming (SQP)/interior-point (IP) method; it includes efficient routines for computing sparse derivatives by applying graph-coloring methods to finite differences, structure-preserving sparse named after Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb and Shanno (BFGS) update techniques for Hessian approximations, and sparse linear algebra. Furthermore it is based on reverse communication, which offers an unprecedented level of interaction between user and nonlinear programming (NLP) solver. It was chosen by ESA as the European NLP solver on the basis of its high robustness and its application-driven design and development philosophy. Two large-scale optimization problems from space applications that demonstrate the robustness of the solver complement the cursory description of general NLP methods and some WORHP implementation details.},

CasADi is a general-purpose tool that can be used to model and solve optimization problems with a large degree of flexibility, larger than what is associated with popular algebraic modeling languages such as AMPL, GAMS, JuMP or Pyomo. Of special interest are problems constrained by differential equations, i.e. optimal control problems. CasADi is written in self-contained C++, but is most conveniently used via full-featured interfaces to Python, MATLAB or Octave. Since its inception in late 2009, it has been used successfully for academic teaching as well as in applications from multiple fields, including process control, robotics and aerospace. This article gives an up-to-date and accessible introduction to the CasADi framework, which has undergone numerous design improvements over the last 7 years.},

@article{Pannocchia2003,
abstract = {Model predictive control algorithms achieve offset-free control objectives by adding integrating disturbances to the process model. The purpose of these additional disturbances is to lump the plant-model mismatch and/or unmodeled disturbances. Its effectiveness has been proven for particular square cases only. For systems with a number of measured variables (p) greater than the number of manipulated variables (m), it is clear that any controller can track without offset at most m controlled variables. One may think that m integrating disturbances are sufficient to guarantee offset-free control in the m controlled variables. We show this idea is incorrect and present general conditions that allow zero steady-state offset. In particular, a number of integrating disturbances equal to the number of measured variables are shown to be sufficient to guarantee zero offset in the controlled variables. These results apply to square and nonsquare, open-loop stable, integrating and unstable systems.},

abstract = {This paper presents an updated and comprehensive description of offset-free MPC algorithms for nonlinear (and linear) discrete-time systems, with the intended objectives of clarifying the main concepts, showing new results, highlighting subtleties by means of challenging applications. First, the offset-free tracking problem for nonlinear systems is presented, putting a strong accent on the role of the disturbance model and observer, and then novel and stronger offset-free estimation results are presented. Next, recent advances in linear offset-free MPC are described, which show the equivalence of the velocity form algorithm (so far considered an alternative method) to a particular disturbance model and observer. Then, the concepts of offset-free estimation are exploited to design an offset-free economic MPC algorithm, which can asymptotically achieve the highest economic performance despite persistent model errors and disturbances. Extensive application results are presented to show the benefits of offsetfree MPC algorithms over standard ones, and to clarify misconceptions and design errors that can prevent constraint satisfaction, closed-loop stability, and offset-free performance.},
